# Little Button 2.0

This is a super cool web app that utilizes scheduled emails to gather and display fun information about your team members. This means that your team can start using this app without doing anything or learning how to use any websites!

This app is currently being tested at [Loose Button](https://loosebutton.com/). You can view the login screen [here](http://littlebutton.dracoli.com/). Only Loose Button members can sign up at the moment. 

For screenshots of the application, view it on my website [here](http://www.dracoli.com/#/projects/little-button).
